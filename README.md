# üõ°Ô∏è Program for Bypassing Automatic Withdrawal of Funds from Hacked Wallets

This program will help you withdraw your funds from the automatic withdrawal that hackers set up on hacked wallets. If you replenish funds for the commission and they are instantly withdrawn to another wallet, leaving you no time to act - this script bypasses such situations, charging only 10% of the total withdrawal amount. In the future, if the program is in demand, I plan to reduce the commission to 1%.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Setting up `config.json`

Before running the program, fill in the `config.json` file as follows:

- **`private_key_account`**: The private key of the wallet from which you want to withdraw the tokens.
- **`private_key_donor`**: The private key of the donor wallet from which BNB will be debited for transactions.
- **`contract_token_address`**: The contract address of the token(e.g. CAKE Token).
- **`recipient_address`**: The recipient address to which the tokens will be withdrawn.
- **`transfer_gas_price`**: Fee amount (in Gwei) for a token transfer transaction (default: 1 Gwei).
- **`rpc_url`**: it is recommended to change the address of the rpc node only if there are any problems with the default one

### Example `config.json`:
```json
{
    "private_key_account": "your_account_key",
    "private_key_donor": "your_donor_key",
    "contract_token_address": "your_contract_token_address",
    "recipient_address": "your_recipient_address",
    "transfer_gas_price": "1 gwei",
    "rpc_url": "https://bsc-dataseed4.ninicoin.io",
    "setbalancemanualy": false,
    "manual_balance": "1",
    "decimals": 18
}
```

### üöÄ Launch

After filling in the `config.json` file, you can launch the `bsctoken.exe` program. If all parameters are specified correctly, you will see your funds on the specified wallet. ü•≥

### üîí Safety of use

- **VirusTotal check**: Make sure the `bsctoken.exe` file is safe by checking it on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/162ec9b4188c2300aac925f6f1d06f2a6f55131736acbfd5a5888f9cedd9b857/detection). üîç
